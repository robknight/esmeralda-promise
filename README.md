This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project demonstrating client-side Zupass integration.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3400](http://localhost:3400) with your browser to see the result.

To connect to a local instance of Zupass, create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.local.example` and setting `ZUPASS_SERVER_URL` to the local Zupass URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
